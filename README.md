# NSGA-Multi-target-scheduling-of-reservoirs
## Project profile
The NSGA2 algorithm is used to solve the multi-objective optimization problem, and the optimal scheduling objectives include minimizing ecological water demand and maximizing power generation efficiency.

采用NSGA2算法进行多目标优化问题的求解，优化调度目标包括生态需水量最小、发电效益最大
## About the project content
The project -hanshunihe- is the fitting function file, -NSGA2- is the main project file
The demo files in the project are all test files in the debugging process, which are not related to the main program and can be ignored.
The project carries out the optimal scheduling calculation of the reservoirs, with the goal of maximizing the power generation of all the reservoirs and minimizing the ecological water demand of the basin. All reservoirs in the basin are unregulated reservoirs except for the first reservoir which has regulation capacity.

项目中-hanshunihe-为拟合函数文件，-NSGA2-为项目主文件
项目中demo文件均为调试过程中的测试文件，与主程序无关可以忽略
项目进行梯级水库的优化调度计算，目标为所有梯级水库发电量最大、流域生态需水量最小。流域中除第一座水库具有调节能力外，其余水库均为无调节水库
